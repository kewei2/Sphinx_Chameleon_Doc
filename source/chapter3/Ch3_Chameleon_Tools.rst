Chameleon Tools
==========================================

As defined above (see the opening paragraph of this document), a tool is a Chameleon plugin (including UI and back-end code) that lets the users work on a specific type of task, such as image classification, tile marking, oil tank marking, etc. This section describes the tools and contains instructions on how to create batches for each tool.
