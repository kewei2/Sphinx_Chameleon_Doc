Introduction
==========================================

Chameleon is a web tool for distributing manual tasks to external or internal workers.

A task is a unit of work, performed by a single person. The task has user interface (UI) that varies depending on the type of task. Tasks are grouped in batches. A batch can contain any number of tasks, as long as they are all of the same type.

Batches can be available to everybody, or assigned to one or more workers. If a batch is not marked as available to everybody, only the assigned workers will be able to perform tasks of that batch.

Some types of tasks allow work to be reviewed by an administrator and, if necessary, the work on a task can be rejected and returned to the worker.  Chameleon provides a set of tools – components that provide front-end and back-end necessary to handle different tasks. The tools are described in the Chameleon Tools section and the instructions of creating new tools – in the Writing Chameleon Tools section.

This document is a brief description of Chameleon from both user and developer point of view. It also has the distinction of being the only first (?) technical document in the world that includes a picture of a cross-eyed cat.
