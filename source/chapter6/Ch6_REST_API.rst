REST API
==========================================

Behind the Chameleon client described above, sits the REST API documented in this section. The preferred way to access the API is through the client, but if you are not using Python or feel you can't  be bothered with services, you can make the direct HTTP calls as described below. Keep in mind that the API is in process of being extended and updated â€“ this means that the REST API may change and by not using the client you are not insulated against those changes.  Also, if you feel there is a need for a particular operation in the API, please let me know (Alex Avtanski).
