Sample Batches
==========================================

A more-or less up-to-date list of sample batches for Chameleon is maintained in the Chameleon GitHub repository under the samples/batches/ directory. There is at least one batch for each of the tools in this directory, sometimes more. Some of the sample batches may depend on particular information (tiled scenery) on S3, so there is no guarantee that all batches will work out of the box. Still, even non-working batches should be useful as a reference.

In addition, the samples/batches/demo directory contains a set of small and easy to demo batches. The demo batches are described in a separate document, Demo Batches.
