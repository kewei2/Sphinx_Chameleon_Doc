Getting Task Results and Removing Batches
==========================================

Once the batch is complete, the precious results of all this back-breaking toil have to be carefully preserved.

A completed (or even â€“ partially completed) batch can be downloaded from the Batches page of an admin user. Click the Download button (). This will download a ZIP archive containing the batch information, task results, and the associated data. After downloading the batch will remain on the Chameleon server and (if the batch is not complete) users will be able to continue working on it.
