What's on the Horizon
==========================================

Those are some of the features and functionality changes we are currently working on or hoping to implement soon:

REST API extension and front-end migration. Gradually extending the REST API to support more of the Chameleon functionality. This will allow Chameleon UI to be gradually and seamlessly migrated to use the REST back-end and eventually fully decoupled.
Batch repository redesign and rewrite. The current implementation of the repository for published batches was written just as a quick patch to give us something working until we have time to write a proper repository. The new repository will allow for a much-needed facelift of the repository UI.
Addressing technical debt. So far Chameleon has been able to cope with the evolving requirements and the need for new tools and functionality. Inevitably we've had to take some shortcuts here and there, that start to slowly weigh on Chameleon's ability to evolve.
UI Improvements. Despite the occasional facelift, Chameleon's UI is aging. Apart from this, the UI has been designed for simplicity and flexibility – to be easy to change quickly as new requirements arise – and not for user convenience. Now that the requirements are more or less clear a UI code rewrite will be welcome.
Retiring and replacing outdated Chameleon tools. Some of the tools that are used in Chameleon date from the time predating Chameleon itself. They were written with a different infrastructure in mind and are now showing their age. While the introduction of new tools (most notably the Image Stack tool) already allows some of the older tools to be deprecated, there is still work that need to be done.
